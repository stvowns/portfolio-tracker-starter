# AI Planner Assistant – Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

The AI Planner Assistant is a full-stack web application that lets users manage their schedules, tasks, and expenses through a conversational interface powered by GPT-4o. Built on a modern Next.js 15 template, it provides secure user authentication, a dynamic dashboard, and an AI chat page where natural language commands translate into database actions—like creating calendar events or logging expenses. This system ensures each user’s data is private, organized, and easily accessible.

We’re building this assistant to simplify everyday planning: instead of clicking through multiple forms, users just type or speak simple commands (e.g., “Schedule a dentist appointment next Wednesday at 3 PM”). The key success criteria are: 1) Users can sign up, log in, and see a personalized dashboard; 2) The AI reliably interprets commands into tasks, events, and expenses; 3) Data remains secure and consistent; and 4) The interface is fast, intuitive, and visually consistent.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope (Version 1):**
- User sign-up, sign-in, and session management (Better Auth)
- Protected dashboard showing a calendar, to-do list, and expense tracker with user-specific data
- AI chat interface (`/app/chat`) for free-form commands
- API route (`/api/chat`) that calls OpenAI GPT-4o, parses JSON output, and performs CRUD operations via Drizzle ORM
- Database schema for users, calendar events, tasks, and expenses (PostgreSQL + Drizzle)
- Core UI built with Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui components
- Docker configuration for local development with PostgreSQL

**Out-of-Scope (Later Phases):**
- Push or email notifications/reminders
- Recurring events or complex scheduling rules
- Integration with external calendars (Google, Outlook)
- Multi-tenant or team collaboration features
- Mobile-specific UI (native apps)
- Advanced analytics or budget forecasting

## 3. User Flow

A new visitor lands on the welcome page and sees prompts to sign up or log in. They create an account with email and password (Better Auth handles verification). Upon successful login, they are redirected to a protected dashboard where a left sidebar offers links to “Dashboard,” “Chat,” and “Profile.” The main area displays today’s events on a calendar, a list of pending tasks, and a summary of recent expenses.

To interact with the AI, the user clicks “Chat.” This opens a conversation panel with a message list and input box at the bottom. The user types a command like “Add a $50 grocery expense for Friday.” The app sends it to `/api/chat`; after processing with GPT-4o, the backend returns structured JSON, automatically inserting a new expense into the database. When the user returns to the dashboard, the expense appears in the tracker and charts.

## 4. Core Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Sign-up, sign-in, session management, protected routes.
- **Dashboard**: Calendar view (events), to-do list, expense summary with interactive charts.
- **AI Chat Interface**: Conversational UI for natural language commands.
- **Chat API Endpoint**: `/api/chat` that validates sessions, calls GPT-4o, parses structured output, and triggers database operations.
- **Database Models**: `users`, `calendarEvents`, `tasks`, `expenses` via PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM.
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui building blocks (Buttons, Inputs, Cards, Tables, Charts).
- **Docker Setup**: One-command local environment with Next.js server and PostgreSQL.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful UI feedback for API or network failures.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui component library
- **Authentication**: Better Auth (NextAuth-like flow)
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Node.js 18+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM for type-safe schema and queries
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o (function-calling for structured JSON)
- **Containerization**: Docker (Next.js + PostgreSQL services)
- **Development Tools**: VS Code with ESLint, Prettier
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect) or optional Zustand for chat history

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Page loads under 500ms; AI chat response under 2 seconds (network permitting).
- **Scalability**: Modular API routes and database schemas allow horizontal scaling.
- **Security**: All API routes require authenticated sessions; use HTTPS in production; store secrets in environment variables; follow OWASP Top 10 best practices.
- **Reliability**: Automatic retries for transient DB or AI API errors, with user-friendly error messages.
- **Usability**: Accessible UI components (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation), consistent styling.
- **Maintainability**: Clean folder structure, TypeScript types for data contracts, documented code and prompts.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- **OpenAI Availability**: Assumes GPT-4o API key is provisioned and rate limits are respected.
- **Environment**: Node 18+ runtime, Docker installed locally, modern browser support (ES6+).
- **Data Volume**: Initial user base expected to be small to medium; no sharding needed in V1.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Relies on well-crafted prompts and function schemas to ensure consistent AI output.
- **Network**: Users have stable internet for chat interactions.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **Unpredictable AI Responses**: GPT may return unexpected JSON shapes. Mitigation: validate and sanitize AI output, provide fallback UI flows for manual input.
- **API Rate Limits**: Exceeding OpenAI limits can block chat. Mitigation: implement exponential backoff and inform user of delays.
- **Database Migrations**: Schema updates can break existing data. Mitigation: use migration tools, keep dev/prod schemas in sync.
- **Docker Performance**: On some systems, Docker-mounted volumes can be slow. Mitigation: document volume caching or local Postgres installation as alternative.
- **Error Handling Gaps**: Unhandled exceptions in `/api/chat` could crash the route. Mitigation: wrap calls in try/catch and return structured error messages.

This PRD provides a clear, unambiguous blueprint for the AI Planner Assistant. It outlines what to build, how users will interact with it, and the technical foundation required—enabling the AI or your development team to generate detailed technical specifications, UI wireframes, and implementation plans without missing any critical information.
