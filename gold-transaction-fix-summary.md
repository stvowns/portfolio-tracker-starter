# Gold Transaction Fix Summary

## Problem
When adding a gold transaction for 1 gram at 5500 TL, the current value and average cost were both showing 5500 TL, which is incorrect. The current value should reflect the current market price of gold, not the purchase price.

## Root Causes
1. **Missing Market Price Updates**: When creating a gold asset or adding a transaction, the system wasn't fetching the current market price for gold.
2. **Incorrect Fallback Logic**: When no current price was available, the system was using the average purchase price as a fallback, making the current value always equal to the cost.
3. **Redundant Calculation**: The average price was being calculated in a roundabout way that was essentially the same as the average buy price.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Transaction API (`app/api/portfolio/transactions/route.ts`)
- Added logic to fetch current market price for GOLD and SILVER when a transaction is added
- Updates the asset's currentPrice field with the latest market price

### 2. Fixed Assets API (`app/api/portfolio/assets/route.ts`)
- Added logic to fetch current market price when creating a new GOLD or SILVER asset
- Fixed the fallback logic to show 0 instead of using average price when no current price is available
- Simplified the average price calculation to avoid redundancy

### 3. Fixed Portfolio API (`app/api/portfolio/route.ts`)
- Fixed the fallback logic to show 0 instead of using net amount when no current price is available
- Simplified the average price calculation to avoid redundancy
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to type conversions

## How It Works Now
1. When creating a gold asset or adding a gold transaction, the system:
   - Creates the asset/transaction as before
   - Fetches the current market price from Yahoo Finance API
   - Updates the asset's currentPrice field with the market price

2. When calculating portfolio values:
   - If a current market price is available, it uses that price × quantity
   - If no current price is available, it shows 0 (instead of using the purchase price)
   - The average cost remains based on the actual purchase price

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- When you add 1 gram of gold at 5500 TL:
  - Average Cost: 5500 TL (based on your purchase price)
  - Current Value: Current market price × 1 gram (e.g., if market price is 5600 TL, current value will be 5600 TL)
  - Profit/Loss: Current Value - Average Cost (e.g., 100 TL profit if market price is 5600 TL)

## Testing
A test script (`test-gold-transaction.js`) has been created to verify the fix. It will:
1. Create a gold asset
2. Add a transaction
3. Check if the average price and current value are different

## Notes
- The fix applies to both GOLD and SILVER assets
- The system will now always try to fetch the latest market price for these commodities
- If the market price fetch fails, the current value will show 0 until a price is successfully fetched
